`fcci` provides support for building [Feldman-Cousins](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.57.3873) confidence 
intervals.

The Feldman-Cousins construction was originally developed in the context of 
High-Energy Physics, as a consistent method for the estimation of Poisson rates 
of very rare events. In experiments which expect very few events, it is often 
the case that the number of observed events is actually zero or, more generally, 
lower than the expected number of spurious background events (if the 
latter is significantly larger than zero). In these situations, usual central intervals (such as those produced by `stats::poisson.test()`) are not 
satisfying, as they can lead both to overcoverage and to non-physical negative 
rates in the presence of a non-negligible background.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `fcci` from 
[GitHub](https://github.com/vgherard/fcci) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("vgherard/fcci")
```
## Example

```{r}
library(fcci)
```

To compute a confidence interval for, e.g., a Poisson rate, use:

```{r}
# 95% C.L. interval for n = 10 events and b = 2 expected background events
confint_pois(n = 10, b = 2, cl = 0.95)
```

Let us compare the 68% C.L. intervals for $n=0$ events and no background 
obtained from `fcci` and from `stats::poisson.test()` 

```{r}
confint_pois(n = 0, cl = 0.68)
stats::poisson.test(0, conf.level = 0.68, alternative = "two.sided")$conf.int
```

Notice that the latter is significantly larger, and it corresponds in fact to
an 84% C.L. *upper limit* on the rate:

```{r}
stats::poisson.test(0, conf.level = 0.84, alternative = "less")$conf.int
```
